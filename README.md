`hey` is a tiny program that sends some load to a web application.

`hey` was originally called boom and was influenced from Tarek Ziade's
tool at [tarekziade/boom](https://github.com/tarekziade/boom). Using the same name was a mistake as it resulted in cases
where binary name conflicts created confusion.
To preserve the name for its original owner, we renamed this project to `hey`.

## Building

You can build the hey binaries using `make`
```shell
make
```
This will run all the `go build` commands under the `release` section of the [Makefile](Makefile). The resulting binaries will be under the `bin` directory.

## Installation

Download the binary from the following links:
* Linux 64-bit x86: https://eldada.jfrog.io/artifactory/tools/hey/hey_linux_amd64
* Linux 64-bit ARM: https://eldada.jfrog.io/artifactory/tools/hey/hey_linux_arm64
* Mac 64-bit:       https://eldada.jfrog.io/artifactory/tools/hey/hey_darwin_amd64
* Windows 64-bit:   https://eldada.jfrog.io/artifactory/tools/hey/hey_windows_amd64

### Package Managers

-  [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) users can use `brew install hey`.

## Usage

hey runs provided number of requests in the provided concurrency level and prints stats.

It also supports HTTP2 endpoints.

```
Usage: hey [options...] <url>

Options:
  -n  Number of requests to run. Default is 200.
  -c  Number of workers to run concurrently. Total number of requests cannot
      be smaller than the concurrency level. Default is 50.
  -q  Rate limit, in queries per second (QPS) per worker. Default is no rate limit.
  -z  Duration of application to send requests. When duration is reached,
      application stops and exits. If duration is specified, n is ignored.
      Examples: -z 10s -z 3m.
  -o  Output type. If none provided, a summary is printed.
      "csv" is the only supported alternative. Dumps the response
      metrics in comma-separated values format.

  -m  HTTP method, one of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS.
  -H  Custom HTTP header. You can specify as many as needed by repeating the flag.
      For example, -H "Accept: text/html" -H "Content-Type: application/xml" .
  -t  Timeout for each request in seconds. Default is 20, use 0 for infinite.
  -A  HTTP Accept header.
  -d  HTTP request body.
  -D  HTTP request body from file. For example, /home/user/file.txt or ./file.txt.
  -T  Content-type, defaults to "text/html".
  -a  Basic authentication, username:password.
  -x  HTTP Proxy address as host:port.
  -h2 Enable HTTP/2.

  -host	HTTP Host header.

  -disable-compression  Disable compression.
  -disable-keepalive    Disable keep-alive, prevents re-use of TCP
                        connections between different HTTP requests.
  -disable-redirects    Disable following of HTTP redirects
